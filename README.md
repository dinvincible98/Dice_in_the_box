# ME314-Final-Project

# Overview

This is a default project "Jack/Dice in the box" for ME314 Machine Dynamics at Northwestern University. The goal of this project is to simulate a box bouncing inside of a moving box. The drawing below shows the configuration and transformation of frames I used. For simulation, I simulate the dice starting at the center of the box with zero initial velocity and zero theta for 5 seconds with a time step of 0.01s.

* Transformations of frame in the program are list below:

      g_WB1: The transformation from world to center of the box(0, x_box, y_box)

      g_WB2: The transformation from center of the box to final box frame(theta_box,0, 0)

      g_WD1: The transformation from world to center of the dice(0, x_dice, y_dice)

      g_WD2: The transformation from center of the box to final dice frame(theta_dice,0, 0)

      g_WB: The transformation from world to box frame.(g_WB1*g_WB2)

      g_WD: The transformation from world to dice frame.(g_WD1*g_WD2)

      g_BD: Transformation from box frame to dice frame.(g_WB^-1 *g_WD)

#  Calculation Description

* Eular-Lagrange Equations & External forces & Constraint:

To calculate the EL-Equations, the first thing to do is to find the kinetic and potential energy of the
whole system (Box and Dice). The velocity of the dice and box can be calculated by their rigid-body
transformation from world frame(g_WB and g_WD). The inertia matrices is a diagonal matrix of
vector [1, 1, J_box/J_dice] and I used 1 for both inertia of box and dice (Assume the center of the mass
is the center of the geometry). The kinetic energy then can be calculated after finding the velocity and
inertia matrices. The potential energy of the system is also calculated from the rigid-body
transformation of objects in world frame. After getting the kinetic and potential energy of the system, I can derive the Lagrangian equation of the system.

Formulas:

      KE = 0.5 * ((V_box.T) * I_box * V_box + (V_dice.T) * I_dice * V_dice) 
      
      PE = g * (m1 * h_box + m2 *h_dice)
      
      L = KE - PE

Then, I can derive the EL- equations using the Lagrangian equations. The external forces in
this system apply to the x and y of the box so the box will move along a diagonal line. The force is
large enough that the box is constrained along the trajectory and the impact should not affect x and y
velocity of the box.

      xd_box = -cos(t * pi/360)               # Desird trajectory in x direction
      
      yd_box = sin(t * pi/360)                # Desird trajectory in y direction
      
      Fx = -k * (x_box - xd_box)              # Force in x direction
      
      Fy = -k * (y_box - yd_box) + m1 * g     # Force in y direction

To fully construct the EL â€“ equations, the external forces should be apply to the right hand side of the
EL - equations. And the final EL is shown below:

* Impact updates:

Impact Equations:

      

The impact update involves the configuration of dice and box. To detect impacts, I defined a phi_impact function. This function takes an input current configuration and returns a 8-vector matrix consist of 8 elements: A_dx, B_dx, C_dx, D_dx, A_dy, B_dy, C_dy, D_dy. Each element stands for the x or y configuration of the vertices of the dice.(A, B, C, D are 4 vertices of the dice shown in graph). The dice is likely to hit the box if it moving faster than the box. if velocity of dice is smaller than box in x or y direction, the four phi equations of each vertices should be in form (dx Or dy + L/2). If the velocity of the dice is larger, then each vertices should be in form (dx or dy - L/2). Once all phi equations change signs, impact may occur. Nevertheless, when the dice is so close to box that onevertex already exceeds boundary, sign of phi may not have changed when calling impact_condition function. To eliminate this exception, the phi_impact function checks if any x or y values of vertex exceeds a maximum (L/2) and returns corresponding index of phi in the matrix that should be experiencing impact.

After getting all phi conditions, the impact_update function will takes a current configuration and calculates the next configuration after impacting. At start of function, phi_impact is called to receive a matrix for phi equations. Then, the index of phi is determined based on the minimum distance between x or y value of the vertex and the side of the box. Finally, this function will return a new configuration that is calculated by a non-zero lambda result.
